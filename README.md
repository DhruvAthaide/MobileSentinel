<p style="text-align: justify;">This is an Android Application that I created using Java in Android Studio. The Main Theme behind this application is related to cybersecurity. This application can be used by the user to perform cybersecurity related tasks or protect themselves from bad actors or threats that are stealing data or performing malicious commands.

Keep in mind, this application is only to be used for Educational purposes!</p>



## Current Features:

- Live Network Scanner
- CVE Engine / Vulnerability Scanner
- Mobile Network Traffic Sniffer
- SSH Client
- Application Permission Analyzer
- Password Generator
- Port Scanner

## Future Features: 
- Wifi Cracking (Live Network Scanner)
## Explanation of Features:

#### Live Network Scanner

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Live Network Scanner will contiously scan around your Android Phone for Networks which are available and will show whether they are password locked or are available to connect. (More Features will be added in the future such as Wifi Cracking in the Live Network Scanner)</p>

#### CVE Engine / Vulnerability Scanner

<p style="text-align: justify;">The CVE Enginer or the Vulnerability Scanner is a feature that is currently in development. The Vulnerability Scanner can take in inputs of Company Name/Product Name or CVE Number(Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) and will search the NIST Database or a CVE Database to retrive the information related to that Vulnerability in a specific application or company.</p>

#### Mobile Network Traffic Sniffer

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Mobile Network Traffic Sniffer is a Feature which will continously scan the inbound and outbound packets that the Android phone is currently sending and will list them on the screen so that the user knows what is happenning in real time.</p>

#### SSH Client

<p style="text-align: justify;">The SSH Client (Secure Shell) is a Feature that allows the user to securely sending commands to a computer over an unsecured network. SSH uses cryptography to authenticate and encrypt connections between devices. This Feature allows the user to send the commands from the Android Phone also.</p>

#### Application Permission Analyzer

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Permission Analyzer is a Feature that lists out all the applications currently installed in the user's phone and the user can then check out all the permissions that that application is allowed and the Feature also highlights the permissions that are not necessary for that application. This brings the user's attention to applications that might be performing illegal or stealthy moves to steal the data on the Android Phone.</p>

### Password Generator

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Password Generator is a Feature that allows the user to generate a unique password using the different options provided such as the length of the password, what characters to include in the password or what symbols to include in the password, not to include duplicates in the password, etc.</p>

### Port Scanner

<p style="text-align: justify;">The Port Scanner is a Feature that allows the user to check all the ports on the Android Phone and see which port is open and might be transmitting information to an attacker. This is helpful as it helps the user understand whether their phone's information might be transmitting or not.</p>
